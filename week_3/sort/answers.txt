What sort1 uses: Bubble Sort
How do you know?:
The performance degrades with larger input sizes and particularly with random data strongly indicates
a Bubble Sort.
Also it performs poorly on larger datasets and exhibits significant spikes in execution time with random input,
which aligns with the observed behavior.

What sort2 uses: Merge Sort
How do you know?:
it shows better results handling the bigger files.
Also their times are consistently good between other results in this exercise.
Execution times are well close to the behavior of Merge Sort.

What sort3 uses: Selection Sort
How do you know?:
While the performance with random data suggests a selection-based algorithm,
it aligns with the behavior of Selection Sort.
