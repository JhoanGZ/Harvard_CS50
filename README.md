# CS50 Course Repository

This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS50, Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. 

## About CS50

CS50 is designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike.
The course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. 
Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, and data structures.

Problem sets are inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
More than just teaching you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately.

## Course Structure

The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages. 
Through C, you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory, and all. 
The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. 
Toward the term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. 

The course culminates in a final project.

## Topics Covered

- Computational thinking
- Abstraction
- Algorithms
- Data structures
- Introduction to C programming
- Introduction to Python programming
- Introduction to SQL
- Web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Personal Thoughts

The decision to start this course is to widen my view of different teaching approaches and gain more knowledge in the basics of CS. 

In my opinion, a good foundation serves for the long run in a professional enterprise. Additionally, I wanted to learn from another point of view and teaching practices.
