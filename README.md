## Overview

The projects in this repository serve as practical exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts learned in computer science courses and self-study. 
By implementing algorithms, data structures, and software applications from scratch, I aim to deepen my understanding of core principles and gain hands-on experience in software development.

## Project List

1. **Data Structures Implementation**: Implementations of common data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. (Mostly in C)
2. **Algorithms Practice**: Solutions to algorithmic problems from various sources including LeetCode, HackerRank, and Project Euler.
3. **Software Development Projects**: Full-fledged software projects showcasing skills in software design, development, and testing.
4. **Programming Language Exploration**: Exploration of different programming languages by building small projects and utilities.

## Installation

To run the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install any necessary dependencies (specified in each project's README, if applicable).
