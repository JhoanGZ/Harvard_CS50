# CS50 Course Repository

This repository contains my coursework and projects for CS50, Harvard University’s intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

## Personal Thoughts

 The decision to start this course is to expand my vision of different approaches in programming and thus acquire more knowledge in Computer Science Fundamentals.

 In my opinion, a good foundation serves for the long run into my professional enterprise.
 Additionally, I wanted to learn from another point of view and teaching practices.

## About CS50

 CS50 is designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike. 
 The course teaches how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. 

 Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, and data structures.

 Problem sets are inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
 More than just teaching how to program in one language, this course teaches how to program fundamentally and how to teach oneself new languages ultimately.

## Course Structure

 The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages. 

 Through C, it's not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory, and all. 

 The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. 
 Toward the term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike.

 The course culminates in a final project.
