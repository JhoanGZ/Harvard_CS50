## Thoughts

The project originated from a concept that emerged when I began my studies in computer science.

The goal was to create a way to organize my notes related to code, especially when I started studying data structures.

Driven by my desire to improve my learning and skills, I wanted to push myself further and decided to embark on this endeavor.

<i>CS50 gave me the opportunity to do it</i> ‚ù§.

Conceived as a full-stack application, it's not as massive as a commercial application, but I aimed to capture the spirit of it by applying relevant concepts and getting used to them.

I saw this as an opportunity to work with key concepts of application development, utilizing technologies in demand in the market, as my goal is to enhance my developer skills.

The purpose of this web application is to manage data, handle easy and simple interactions, and deliver dynamic content on both the server and client sides.

Finally, I must say that achieving this project required many hours of work, sweat, and commitment, but it was truly worthwhile and an exciting journey!

Thanks to you in advance fo reading these lines!
